Sure, here's an example `README.md` file for the Express.js starter code we created earlier:

# Express.js Starter

This is a simple starter code for creating a blog website with Express.js.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project, run:

```
yarn
```

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

To start the server with nodemon, run:

```
npm run dev
```

## Structure

This starter code follows a simple MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, with the following directory structure:

```
├── controllers
│   └── post.controller.js
├── models
│   └── post.model.js
├── routes
│   └── post.routes.js
├── services
│   └── post.service.js
├── index.js
└── package.json
```

- `controllers`: Contains the controller logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- `models`: Contains the database schema and model definitions using Mongoose.
- `routes`: Contains the route definitions for mapping HTTP requests to controller functions.
- `services`: Contains the business logic for handling data between the controllers and the models.
- `index.js`: The entry point for the application.
